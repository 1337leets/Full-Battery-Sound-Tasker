# Full-Battery-Sound (Tasker)
A Tasker profile that will play the chosen sound when the battery is full.

* Import the profile by holding on the profiles section.
* Go to profile settings and pick the sound file that you want to be played under the Task Variables section.
(You can also use the sfx0.mp3 that i added to this repo, which i made with a bash script using SoX commands.)
